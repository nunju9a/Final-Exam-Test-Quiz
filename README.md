# Final-Exam-Test-Quiz

This quiz is based mostly on questions from the FSJS Final Exam study guide. There will be 20 questions and a timer of 15 minutes (On average, this only gives 45 seconds per question, which is actually LESS time per question than the final exam). 14 out of 20 will be considered passing.  To run - download this repo, and open the index.html file (preferably in chrome). 

I did NOT create this quiz from scratch - I found a very simple open source quiz from codepen and altered/updated it to make it run best for what was needed. There may be some minor issues, feel free to let me know what could be changed and/or improved!

P.S. - There is an audio player with controls embeded at the bottom with an appropriate song!
